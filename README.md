This is a simple script to add faint lines to partition images as guide lines for drawing practice. It also pads blank space to fit the image into a standard paper ratio (such as A4).

Usage: python art_partition.py FILE_PATH [HORIZONTAL] [VERTICAL]

If a directory is given, all the image files in the directory will be processed into a new directory.
